# GitHub-CustomFunctions (Optional)
Exercise for GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis at Kansas State University

### Instructions:

Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment <code>GitHub-CustomFunctions</code> and clone the new repository as a local personal repository.  Once again, we will use the compressed ArcGIS Pro project file from the <code>GitHub-Rasters</code> exercise.  It can be found in the "Working with Rasters" module in Canvas or <code>W:\GEOG\Courses\GEOG728\Exercises\GitHub-Rasters.zip</code>.  Uncompress the provided ZIP file to access the ArcGIS Pro project file and store it in your local repository workspace.  This week, two files must be pushed to origin at the conclusion of the exercise - <code>GitHub-CustomFunctions.py</code> and <code>CalculateNdwi.py</code>. There is no requirement to prepare and submit a script-based tool.  Should you encounter difficulties during the week, seek assistance by posting an issue in GitHub.

### Task:

Write a create a custom function in a module called <code>CalculateNdwi.py</code> that calculates the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for a Landsat 8 image. The function should be able to be called from another script AND run on its own.  Use your new module/function in a new script called <code>GitHub-CustomFunctions.py</code> that properly calculates NDWI from a Landsat 8 image and saves the resulting image with a custom filename ending with "_NDWI".

## Rubric:

Review the assignment rubric available on Canvas for additional details about how your work will be assessed. Double-check that your script includes a complete header section, uses good commenting, incorporates line spaces between blocks of code, and reads input and writes output to current workspace.

## Submission:

Commit your code changes for <code>GitHub-CustomFunctions.py</code> and <code>CalculateNdwi.py</code> to your assignment repository on GitHub.
